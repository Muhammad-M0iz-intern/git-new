# Prompt: write a simple add functiom for 2 number and be consize and simple

<think>
Okay, the user wants a simple add function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. They mentioned it should be concise and simple. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to create a function that adds two numbers. In JavaScript, the standard way is to use the + operator with two numbers. So, function add(a, b) { return a + b; }, but maybe they want a more descriptive function. Wait, the user said "simple add function", so maybe they want something like a function that's easy to use, like a helper function.

Wait, maybe I should write it in a way that's easy to read and understand. The function name is add, and parameters a and b. Then return the sum. That's straightforward. Let me check: yes, that's concise. No side effects, no loops or anything. So the answer should be a function that adds two numbers.

Alternatively, maybe using a variable and adding them step by step? But that's more complicated. The user specified "simple", so the simplest way is to use the + operator. So the function is as simple as possible.

Here's a simple and concise add function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

This function takes two parameters (numbers) and returns their sum. It is clean, readable, and easy to understand.
